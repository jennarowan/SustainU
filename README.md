# SustainU

## Inspiration
Did you know that if every person on Earth made just one small eco-friendly change in their daily routine, we could collectively make a colossal impact on our planet's future? Inspired by the urgent need to address climate change, the innovation of the tech world, and the dedication of youth-led movements, we're on a mission to turn awareness into action, making eco-conscious choices accessible and rewarding through gamification, community engagement, personalized suggestions, and AI-powered creativity. SustainU is a passionate response to the climate crisis, aiming to harness the incredible potential of individual actions, both big and small, to create a sustainable future. 

## What it does
SustainU is a multifaceted platform designed to inspire and empower individuals to take meaningful actions to combat climate change and promote sustainability. Upon entering the platform, users are prompted to register or create an account, after which they can immediately begin their journey towards sustainable living. After answering certain questions about themselves, users are presented with a variety of tasks, from simple daily actions to larger eco-friendly initiatives, earning points for each completed task. Financial contributions to climate action projects also contribute to points, fostering financial support for sustainability efforts. Community engagement is encouraged through volunteer events. Points can be redeemed for rewards, adding a gamification aspect to the platform. The app fosters a sense of community with user-generated content and showcases the real-world impact of individual actions, promoting awareness and sustainability in an engaging and user-friendly way.

- Implementing the CI/CD workflow: GitHub makes it easy to implement the CI/CD workflow and makes the deployment process easy.

## Best Domain Name from GoDaddy

- Originally, we planned to make a mobile app but since none of us had experience with building a mobile app, we had to switch to making a web platform
- First time working with Next.js


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Collaborating together as a team(even though we were in a hybrid format)
- Completing the project within the given time frame
- Being able to implement most of the technical features

## What we learned
- Efficient time management and collaboration
- Problem-solving abilities

## What's next for SustainU
